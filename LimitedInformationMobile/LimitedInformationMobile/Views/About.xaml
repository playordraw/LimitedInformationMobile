      This is an application that makes an educated guess of what the final standing will be at the end of a Swiss style tournament. The results of the program are intended to be a guideline of what win records will make it into the top eight.

      Top 8 Calculator is a static analysis of a tournament without regard to random events. It also assumes, when a player is paired with another player with less points, the one with the most points wins.
      The results will always be the same for the same inputs.
      With the "Allow Draws" option checked (default) the calculator will attempt to determine when a player should draw intentionally. With the option unchecked the tournament will play out without any draws (i.e. like in MTGO).

      Top 8 Simulator (NYI) is a counterpoint to the Top 8 Calculator. It actually runs through an entire tournament the specified number of times, where the results are not predetermined, and gives you the average results.
