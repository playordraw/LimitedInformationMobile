This is provided as-is.
It has not been worked on in a very long time.

To the best of my memory, all the coding work is done, at least for the first release i was planning, but the UI work still needed to be done.

I'll do the best i can to answer any questions if people have any.

While i have no intention of finishing the project, it would please me greatly to see someone else finish and publish it.
